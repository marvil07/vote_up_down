missing pieces but you need to put them all together.

* vote_up_down.module - Provides a widget for user to vote up/down (+1/-1) for a node.
* vote_storylink.module - Provides a node type suitable for links to storys
* node-storylink.tpl.php - PHPTemplate theming of storylinks
* vote_up_down.css - Adds som css style to the above files.
* user_navigation.module - Replacement user navigation block.

The "vote_up_down.module" can be used on any node type to allow
users to vote +1/-1 on them.

The "vote_storylink.module" give a new node type that is well suited
for a digg.com/reddit.com style site.

The "user_navigation.module" is a replacement user navigation block with
links to, "my account", "my posts" and "log out"

Pages that are generated by "vote_storylink.module":
* storylink (same as storylink/new)
* storylink/new
* storylink/top
* storylink/[uid] (all posts for a user)

Feed that are generated by "vote_storylink.module":
* storylink/new/feed
* storylink/top/feed
* storylink/[uid]/feed

------------------------------
You first need to install the following modules:
* Links Package http://drupal.org/node/24719
* Voting API http://drupal.org/node/36041
  (cvs version after 2006-02-09 of Voting API)

To be able to automatically promote storylinks that have a specified
number of votes to the front page you also need to install: 
* Actions http://drupal.org/project/actions
* Voting Actions http://drupal.org/node/46895

Installation is as simple as creating a directory named 
'vote_up_down' in your 'modules' directory and
copying the modules and the images into it, then 
enabling the modules at 'administer >> modules'.

For configuration options go to 'administer >> settings
>> vote_up_down.


Theme story links:
-----------------
If you use a PHPTemplate theme you can theme storylinks nodes with a
"node-storylink.tpl.php" file. Place it in the folder of your theme.
An example is included that is styled with the css file "vote_up_down.css".

The example include these functions:
* Make the title an external link to the submitted story.
* Inserts the voting widget directly for greater control.
* Inserts the domin of the submitted story url like "(via example.com)".
* Displays a small user picture above the voting widget.


Bookmarklet to submit story links:
---------------------------------
javascript:location.href='http://www.example.com/node/add/storylink?edit[url]='+encodeURIComponent(location.href)+'&edit[title]='+encodeURIComponent(document.title)
